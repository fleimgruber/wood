        <!-- cribbed from my research page -->
          We tried to answer the simple question of what fraction of
          the world's plant species are woody: surprising the answer
          to this is not known.  We surveyed researchers and found a
          huge range of estimates.  We used a trait database that
          spanned 12% of plant diversity, and found that due to
          taxonomic patterns of woodiness, the estimates of woodiness
          were extremely biased.  We used Monte Carlo (sampling)
          methods to correct this bias and found that just under half
          the world's vascular plant species are woody.  Surprisingly
          this was much higher than estimates from researchers, even
          with significant botanical training.
